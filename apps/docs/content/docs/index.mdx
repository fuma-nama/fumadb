description: Introducing FumaDB, a library for library to interact with databases.
---

## Why?

Full-stack web frameworks are getting more popular and there's a need for some libraries to interact with your database, for example:

- Auth libraries (BetterAuth, NextAuth).
- Headless CMS (Payload).
- Self-hostable services, like my comment area library [Fuma Comment](https://fuma-comment.vercel.app).

### The Problems We Solve

- **You cannot always trust the library:** there could be bugs that introduces vulnerability to your database.
- **Versioning database schemas is difficult:** some changes require shutting down the server, and the library author doesn't know if they should be marked as breaking changes.
- **Hard to integrate well into existing pipeline:** you might be using different ORMs and their built-in migration pipeline.
- **Each ORM & database have many inconsistencies:** library authors often need to skim through their docs and write code carefully, making sure the library works for all ORMs and databases.

FumaDB aims to solve them by:

- **Unified Querying Interface** for library author to query your database, it's Prisma-like and supports relations.
- **Unified Schema** for library author to design database schemas, without worrying the underlying ORM consumer uses.
- **Built-in SQL Migrator** for consumers without an existing migration pipeline or ORM, it's built on Kysely but only support widely-supported (safe) operations.

## Getting Started

For library authors, see our [Setup guide](/docs/author/setup).
