title: Overriding Names
description: Override table/column names to avoid conflicts with your database.

## Overview

To override names in FumaDB, you can use the Name Variants API.

For example, if the schema has a `messages` table which conflicts with yours, you can override it:

```ts
import { fumadb } from "fumadb";

// library exposed
const ChatDB = fumadb();

// your code
const client = ChatDB.names({
  messages: {
    sql: "chat_user",
    // you can set for ORMs too, like
    prisma: "ChatUser",
    drizzle: "chatUser",
  },
  // or to rename columns
  "messages.id": {
    sql: "message_id",
  },
}).client();
```

You can also conveniently apply a table name prefix:

```ts
const client = ChatDB.prefix("chat_").client();
```

Do not change the name variants once you have initialized the schema on your
database.

You will need to migrate your database again if you've updated the name variants.
